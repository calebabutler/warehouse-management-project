Plan:
- Decide the design that the database should have
- Complete backend REST API for dealing with said database
- Decide the design the UI should have (generally)
- Implement UI in HTML/CSS
- Connect front end with back end using TypeScript
- Finishing touches, ensure I met the requirements, additional features,
  improved look and feel with alternative HTML/CSS
